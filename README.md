# oauth2

For making this basic Oauth2 "tool" you just need your localhost, redirect_URL, Client ID and Secret Client.
Variables are already set so not a big deal, just go on https://discord.com/developers/applications create ur bot and u should be set.

This is not even made atp i just needed the github version lol
